# Extend the base Python image
# See https://hub.docker.com/_/python for version options
# N.b., there are many options for Python images. We used the plain
# version number in the pilot. YMMV. See this post for a discussion of
# some options and their pros and cons:

# Install any additional OS-level packages you need via apt-get. RUN statements
# add additional layers to your image, increasing its final size. Keep your
# image small by combining related commands into one RUN statement, e.g.,
#
# RUN apt-get update && \
#     apt-get install -y python-pip

# Copy the requirements file into the app directory, and install them. Copy
# only the requirements file, so Docker can cache this build step. Otherwise,
# the requirements must be reinstalled every time you build the image after
# the app code changes. See this post for further discussion of strategies
# for building lean and efficient containers:
